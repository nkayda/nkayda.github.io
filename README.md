**The purpose of this website is to act as a hub for IAT 355 assignments.**

**Made with HTML, CSS, and JS.**

<h3>What I did</h3>
I built a pretty simple website using HTML and CSS, and used some JavaScript to create an interaction with the SVG circles on the Visualizations.html page. I didn’t feel the need to use more advanced JavaScript for interactions, as CSS was enough for the simple hover state changes I wanted to add a sense of interactivity to my site.
On the home page, you can find a landing section with a brief intro on my outlook as a student as well as information about my education, work experience, and skills. At the bottom, I have a couple of images that link to my personal portfolio (from outside of this class) to tie back to past work. In the nav bar, you can find my design portfolio, LinkedIn and Github hyperlinked.
I primarily used flexboxes to create a responsive layout and kept an eye out for appropriate breakpoints to ensure text read smoothly and mobile use was accommodated. I also used some media queries to change the direction of divs when needed.
The site is structured as recommended, but I also created an assets folder to store the images. To add icons and a font I liked, I made use of FontAwesome’s icon library and Google Fonts’ APi, which are both linked in index.html and used in style.css. These are both tools I use often during both work and school, so I was comfortable adding that directly in this assignment (I hope that was ok!)

<h3>Challenges + Solutions</h3>
I ran into some confusion working with SVG’s, as I have never had to build them directly in HTML. Positioning the items took a bit of trial and error, but by following the instructions in the lecture I was able to understand how changing each property affects the location of the shape.
Another challenge I ran into was making sure the 3 column layout for my Education, Experience, and Skills were all the same height and were aligned to the top of each container. I played around with adjusting the height and width properties, as well as justify-content/align-items/align-self and eventually landed on a combination that did what I was looking for.
